## Usage
The web app works in two modes -

**1. Guest Mode ( Only public rooms can be created / joined)**
- Use room name in any format.
- In public rooms, messages are published via laravel server to ably (client can't publish messages directly through echo).

**2. User Mode ( Private rooms can be created / joined)**
- If user signed up and logged in into the Laravel app, it can create/join a private room.
- The required room prefix is `room-<id>`, as defined in `routes/rooms.php`.
- In private rooms, messages are published through Laravel Echo from client-side.
